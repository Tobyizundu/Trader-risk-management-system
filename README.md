This is a personal project I built in my free time to improve my Python programming and GUI development skills. The application helps forex traders implement professional risk management strategies by calculating position sizes, R multiples, and risk-reward ratios.

The primary goal was to learn and practice object-oriented programming with Tkinter and create a user-friendly desktop application that solves real-world problems for traders.

Features
Trade Risk Calculator: Determines maximum risk amount based on account size and risk percentage

R Multiple Calculator: Calculates profit/loss in terms of "R" (risk units) for performance tracking

Pip/Lot Calculator: Analyzes position sizing with stop loss and take profit levels

Risk-Reward Analysis: Automatically calculates and displays risk-reward ratios

Risk Alerts: Warns users when position size exceeds safe risk limits

Professional GUI: Clean, dark-themed interface built with Tkinter and ttk
